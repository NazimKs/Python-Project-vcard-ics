# Python Project
### Presentation:

Here is the final project of the Python course in the L3 Computer Science program at Cergy Paris University.
The main goal of this project is to manipulate digital business cards (vCards) and calendar events (Ics).

Through this project, we are interested in:

	- Reading and displaying a vCard or iCalendar (ICS) file.
	- Modifying the content through a graphical interface and saving those modifications.
	- Converting a file to an HTML code fragment or a CSV file.

### Source Code Composition:
The source code is available in the '/src' folder:

	- 'cli.py' file containing the function that executes the requested procedure in the CLI part of the Python project.
	- 'gui.py' file containing the function that executes the requested procedure in the GUI part of the Python project.
	- 'Convert_VCF.py' file containing the class dedicated to reading and processing data from a VCF file.
	- 'Convert_ICS.py' file containing the class dedicated to reading and processing data from an ICS file.

### Usage:
> To run the console mode (CLI): python3 cli.py, then specify the arguments as needed.
> To run the graphical mode (GUI): python3 gui.py.

### Textual Reports:
 A written report (in English and French) to explain each part done. they are available in the '/doc' folder.

### Documentation:
The documentation created with Doxygen is available in the '/doc' directory.
